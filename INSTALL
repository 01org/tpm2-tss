To build and install the tpm2.0-tss software the following dependencies are
required:
GNU Autoconf
GNU Autoconf archive
GNU Automake
GNU Libtool
C compiler
C Library Development Libraries and Header Files (for pthreads headers)
cmocka unit test framework
pkg-config

Currently the tpm2.0-tss is only distributed via GitHub as we have not yet
produced an official source release. To obtain the tpm2.0-tss sources you
must clone them from the 01.org GitHub organization TPM2.0-TSS git repository:
git clone https://github.com/01org/TPM2.0-TSS

To configure the tpm2.0-tss source code first run the bootstrap script, which
generates list of source files, and creates the configure script:
$ ./bootstrap

Then run the configure script, which generates the makefiles:
$ ./configure

Then compile the code using make:
$ make

Once you've built the tpm2.0-tss software it can be installed with:
$ sudo make install

This will install the libraries and the resource manager to locations
determined at configure time. See the output of ./configure --help for the
available options. Typically you won't need to do much more than provide an
alternative --prefix option at configure time, and maybe DESTDIR at install
time if you're packaging for a distro.

NOTE: It may be necessary to run ldconfig (as root) to update the run-time
bindings before executing a program that links against libsapi or a TCTI
library:
$ sudo ldconfig

We now have basic VPATH support which allows us to separate the source
directory from the build directory. This allows for a developer to do a debug
build and a regular build from the same sources. Any changes to the source
will be buildable from both build directories. Before you attempt this be sure
that the source directory is clean.
